# Crime-in-Boston
Hello readers, i am Emyr, a current student at purwadhika, taking the data science & machine learning course. This file is a mandatory project for the completion of module 2, which focuses on data analysis using both python & Tableu.

This is a Jupyter Notebook file, analyzing the Crimes in Boston data from Kaggle. The analysis consists of data cleaning, data analysis, the creation of multiple figures & plots to aid the analysis, conclusions, and recomendations. 

## Dataset
Crime in Boston :
Link = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston?datasetId=49781&sortBy=dateCreated&sort=published
The Record in this dataset begins in June 14, 2015 and continues to September 3, 2018.

Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred.


## Target of Analysis
- Determine most common crime (also providing Location & Time)
- Determine most common crime which involves shooting (also providing Location & Time)
- Create recomendations for the Boston Police


feel free to take a look / give any suggestions on how i can improve my coding further.

Thank you!
